// definition -  JavaScript (often abbreviated as JS) is a versatile, high-level programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers. Initially developed by Netscape as a means to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites, JavaScript has since become a cornerstone of web development.

//1. Client-Side Scripting:
// Used to create dynamic and interactive web content.
// Common applications include form validation, interactive maps, and animations.
// Server-Side Scripting:
// Enabled by environments like Node.js.
// Allows use of JavaScript for both frontend and backend development.


// 2.Event-Driven:
// Executes code in response to events (e.g., clicks, form submissions, page loads).
// Ideal for interactive and responsive user interfaces.


// 3.Interpreted Language:
// Executed in real time by the browser.
// Facilitates rapid testing and development iteration.

//4. Prototypal Inheritance:
// Objects inherit properties and methods from other objects.
// Differs from classical inheritance used in languages like Java and C++.


//5. Standardized by ECMAScript:
// Governed by the ECMAScript standard.
// ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced significant features (e.g., classes, modules, arrow functions).


//6. Versatile Use Cases:
// Beyond web development: mobile apps (React Native), desktop apps (Electron), game development, IoT.

//7. Libraries and Frameworks:
// Rich ecosystem includes libraries (e.g., jQuery, D3.js) and frameworks (e.g., Angular, React, Vue.js).
// Provides pre-built functions and structured development approaches.

//8. Cross-Browser Compatibility:
// Supported by modern JavaScript engines in all major browsers (e.g., Chrome's V8, Firefox's SpiderMonkey, Safari's JavaScriptCore).
// Ensures consistent code execution across different platforms.
// JavaScript's versatility, ease of use, and extensive community support make it an essential tool for web development and many other applications.
